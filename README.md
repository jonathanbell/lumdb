# Level Up React Movie Database

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanbell/lumdb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonathanbell/lumdb)

This is my finished project after taking the most excellent [React 16 For Everyone](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/react-16-for-everyone) and the [React Testing for Beginners](https://www.leveluptutorials.com/tutorials/react-testing-for-beginners) courses created by Scott Tolinski. This web app looks up current movies and displays them in a slick way.

Example app is here: <https://jonathanbell.github.io/lumdb>
